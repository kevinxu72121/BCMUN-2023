        <p>The Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC), was founded in 1945 as the first committee of the United Nations. The committee was formed along with the UN Charter, serving as a body maintaining peace and security around the world.</p>
        <p>In the Status Quo, DISEC serves one of the major general assemblies of the United Nations, and tackles many issues, including small arms trade, and threats to world peace. This committee is open to delegates of all skills, welcoming 75 delegates to participate in fruitful debate. Position Papers are not mandatory; however, they are mandatory to be considered for awards.</p>

                        <p>Entering her sophomore year at Crofton House School, Yasmin is honoured to serve as the Director of the Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) at BCMUN 2023. Ever since Yasmin witnessed delegates deliver their charismatic and witty speeches at her first conference, she quickly developed an unparalleled curiosity for the intricacies of international affairs. From raising her very first placard to anxiously waiting in the closing ceremony, her unwavering appreciation for political relations has only grown. At BCMUN 2023, Yasmin hopes to engage novice and experienced delegates alike in all that DISEC has to offer. Outside of the committee room, Yasmin can be found passing and hitting volleyballs, organizing her Google calendar, and eating copious amounts of dim sum. At the upcoming iteration, Yasmin awaits a weekend of fierce debate and wishes everyone the best of luck!</p>

After attending his first conference two years ago, Nicholas has continued to foster continued love for the spirited debate of countless moderated caucuses and unmoderated caucuses.  From writing position papers to meeting new people MUN not only has fostered new friendships but a passion for global affairs at home and abroad. Outside the enthralling debate of MUN, Nicholas can be found reading Wikipedia pages, sleeping for long hours, and having long walks with friends. Nicholas looks forward to meeting everyone at BCMUN 2023 and creating a memorable conference for everyone!</p>
