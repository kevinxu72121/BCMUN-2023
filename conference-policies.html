      <p>BCMUN is devoted to ensuring that our conference enables delegates to develop their knowledge of global issues. In order to ensure that all delegates have a positive experience, participants are required to follow our conference policies. By attending our conference, you agree to adhere to the sections shown below. If you have any questions, please contact the Secretary General, Michael Xie, at <a href="mailto:sg@bcmun.org"><u>sg@bcmun.org</u></a>. </p>

      <p>*All delegates registering for BCMUN must be 18 years old or younger.</p>
        
      <h4>Discrimination</h4>
      <p>BCMUN is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for all participants. Discrimination, harassment, and any other forms of unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. Provincial and federal laws regarding discrimination are strictly enforced. Discrimination based on race, color, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other characteristic protected by law are prohibited. All participants are urged to report any instances of discrimination or harassment to our staff or secretariat, who will take appropriate action to address the situation. By upholding these discrimination policies, we aim to create a welcoming and inclusive space where everyone can feel valued and respected.</p>

      <h4>Gender-based Violence</h4>
      <p>At BCMUN, we take the issue of gender-based violence very seriously; strict rules to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all attendees has been implemented. Our policies are in accordance with both provincial and federal laws, and we have zero tolerance for any form of gender-based violence, including but not limited to physical, sexual, emotional, and verbal abuse. Any behavior modeling gender-based violence will result in immediate disciplinary punishments, including a potential removal from the conference without refund.</p>

      <h4>Wifi Policy</h4>
      <p>Unless otherwise specified by your committee director, devices such as laptops and phones will not be given access to wifi. BCMUN believes that conducting appropriate levels of research prior to the conference is crucial to self development. Moreover, well researched delegates enable committee sessions to flow smoother and topics to be debated in more depth. If there are, however, special circumstances in which wifi is required, wifi may be granted. </p>

      <h4>Plagiarism</h4>
      <p>BCMUN strictly prohibits plagiarism in all submissions made by its participants. Plagiarism is a severe offense that compromises the conference's academic integrity and lessens everyone's ability to enrich their academic knowledge. Consequently, BCMUN has a zero-tolerance policy towards plagiarism and will investigate any suspected cases. Any delegates found to have plagiarized their position papers will be removed from consideration for committee awards. Moreover, all delegates are required to appropriately cite sources that they have referred to. By adhering to plagiarism guidelines, BCMUN is dedicated to supporting scholastic excellence and ensuring that every participant has a rewarding experience.</p>
